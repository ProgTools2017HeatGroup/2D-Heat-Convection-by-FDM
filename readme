# Input:1. Parameters of density, rou;
#                        viscosity, vo;
#			 diffusivity, k;
#			 expansion coefficient,a;
#       2. Boundary conditions: Pressure distribution, Px;
#	                        Temperature distribution, T;
#       3. Initial conditions: velocity along x axis: Vx;
#	                       velocity along y axis: Vy;			   
# Output: The final temperature distribution T'; 
#         pressure distribution Px'; 
#	  2D velocity field Vx', Vy'; 
#
# The C++ package will contain a main.cpp file, several sub-functions files and input file: parameters.in; 
# Functions: main.cpp: call all the sub-functions and do the numerical calculation;
#            readin.cpp: read the input values from parameters.in;
#            calmesh.cpp: calculate mesh pionts in x and y direction;
#            calini.cpp: calculate initial filed values using recursion;
#            caltimstep.cpp: calculate stable time step;
#            dofdm.cpp: using finite difference method to do the calculation;
#            output.cpp: write the outcome to output file;
#            ... other functions to be decided;
